This is my version of the famous book  "Dao De Jing" by Laozi. Main purpose behind making this book was to teach myself **_LaTeX_** and to broaden my knowledge of Daoism.

Entirety of the document was written in Overleaf, a great resource for learning and compiling **_LaTeX_** files. Files were compiled using XeLaTeX compiler, and were tested with pdfLaTeX and it worked without any problems.

Text of the book was provided by [yellowbridge.com](https://www.yellowbridge.com/onlinelit/daodejing.php "yellowbridge"), a great place to learn about chinese culture and history,  and by [sacred-texts.com](https://sacred-texts.com/tao/taote.htm "Sacred Texts"), excellent resource for ancient books, texts and scripures of all kinds.
